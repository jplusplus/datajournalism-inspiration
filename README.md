# I just finished the Python course for journalists, what's next?

## Stories that used Python (with code!)

* In [*The Tennis Racket*](http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket) Buzzfeed used Python to analyse betting trends on professional tennis matches and found patterns that suggested match-fixing. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipynb).

* In [*The Ferguson Area Is Even More Segregated Than You Probably Guessed*](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jsvine/the-ferguson-area-is-even-more-segregated-than-you-thought) Buzzfeed used Python to analyse segregation in St. Louis county. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2014-08-st-louis-county-segregation/blob/master/notebooks/segregation-analysis.ipynb).

* In [*The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/) 538 analysed if films that pass the Bechdel Test make more money for their producers? The article was replicated by Brian Keegan using Python and his code can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brianckeegan/Bechdel/blob/master/Bechdel_test.ipynb). Keegan's notebook is a must-read for journalists who aspire to do data-driven reporting.

* Jens Finnäs used Python to analyse the relationship between asylum immigration and crime, and concluded that there was no relationship between the number of asylum seekers in a town and its crime rate. The story was published in *Dagens Samhälle* and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/jensfinnas/dagenssamhalle-notebooks/blob/master/flyktingar_och_brottslighet/Flyktingar%20och%20brottslighet%20i%20kommuner.ipynb).

## Reads

* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a style guide for easy to read and beautiful Python code. The section on [*naming conventions*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) is particularly good to follow.
