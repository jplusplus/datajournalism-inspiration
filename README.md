## Stories that used Python

* In [*The Tennis Racket*](http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket) Buzzfeed used Python to analyse betting trends on professional tennis matches and found patterns that suggested match-fixing. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipynb).

* Jens Finnäs used Python to analyse the relationship between asylum immigration and crime, and concluded that there was no relationship between the number of asylum seekers in a town and its crime rate. The story was published in *Dagens Samhälle* and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/jensfinnas/dagenssamhalle-notebooks/blob/master/flyktingar_och_brottslighet/Flyktingar%20och%20brottslighet%20i%20kommuner.ipynb).
